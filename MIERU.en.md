# Mieru / mita v3.35–v3.36 management

**English** · [Русский](MIERU.ru.md)

See also the product [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [accounting contract](docs/ACCOUNTING.md), and [upgrade procedure](docs/UPGRADING.md).

Proxy Control supports exactly **mita 3.35.x and 3.36.x** through a local, authenticated Unix-socket manager. Mita remains a separate GPLv3+ process; this adapter is MIT and contains no copied upstream source or generated stubs.

## Pinned upstream artifacts

Only download the pinned v3.35.0 or v3.36.0 Debian packages from the exact upstream release URLs below. Verify the **package** digest before extraction; do not install the package merely to obtain the binary. Then extract with `dpkg-deb -x` and verify the separate **`/usr/bin/mita` executable** digest. The manager's `MIERU_MITA_SHA256` runtime gate always uses the executable digest, never the package digest.

Example for v3.36.0 amd64 (substitute one complete pinned row when using another supported version or architecture):

```sh
curl -fL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 \
  https://github.com/enfein/mieru/releases/download/v3.36.0/mita_3.36.0_amd64.deb \
  -o mita_3.36.0_amd64.deb
printf '%s  %s\n' 44622bea7fac732984ac6cf1189e555fd9add1969001e9b2d7cdea9416b5919a mita_3.36.0_amd64.deb | sha256sum -c -
dpkg-deb -x mita_3.36.0_amd64.deb mita-root
printf '%s  %s\n' 38835a88e9b7fb09de0a3b6b5110e3a98719bffd9471aa07ddb7e03dc678a170 mita-root/usr/bin/mita | sha256sum -c -
```

The pinned v3.35.0 and v3.36.0 Debian executables are statically linked. Reserve numeric UID/GID `10005:10005` for the non-login `mieru-manager` identity (fail closed if either number belongs to another principal), add that user to the distinct `mita` socket group, and add the panel service user only to group `10005`. Install `deploy/mieru-manager.service`. Put a random 32–512 character ASCII token in `/etc/mieru-manager/token`, then run `sudo ./scripts/prepare-mieru-token.sh prepare /etc/mieru-manager/token`; the resulting metadata is exactly `root:10005` mode `0440`.

```text
MIERU_PUBLIC_HOST=mieru.example.com
MIERU_MANAGER_TOKEN_FILE=/etc/mieru-manager/token
MIERU_MANAGER_STATE=/var/lib/mieru-manager
MIERU_MITA_SHA256=38835a88e9b7fb09de0a3b6b5110e3a98719bffd9471aa07ddb7e03dc678a170
```

The helper verifies the pinned executable SHA-256 before every invocation and accepts only mita 3.35.x or 3.36.x at bootstrap. It invokes only fixed `/usr/bin/mita` argv commands with in-memory bounded stdout/stderr. Each invocation runs in a new process group; timeout, output-limit, exceptional, and successful completion paths kill remaining same-group descendants before returning. A malicious child can escape that boundary by double-forking and calling `setsid()`, so this containment is not a sandbox and depends on the executable remaining pinned and trusted. Complete secret-bearing JSON is inherited through an anonymous FD and never a named tempfile, command line, log, audit, or HTTP list response. Keep `/run/mita/mita.sock` mode 0770; do not enable `MITA_INSECURE_UDS` in production.

A fresh host must persist one valid generation before enabling the hardened `mita` unit: selected TCP+UDP bindings, one protected bootstrap user, and the all-domain/all-IP WARP SOCKS5 egress rule. Start a temporary `mita run` boundary with the stable UDS, apply a mode-`0600` mita-owned bootstrap JSON, prove `RUNNING`, stop the transient boundary, delete the plaintext input, then enable `deploy/mita.service`. Keep the protected bootstrap user; use separate temporary users for TCP/UDP acceptance and delete those afterward. Starting the hardened unit with an empty/zero-user generation is a hard stop.

For Compose, combine `compose.yaml` and `compose.mieru.yaml`. Set `MIERU_MITA_BIN` to the extracted, executable-digest-verified host binary, `MIERU_MITA_SHA256` to that executable digest, and `MIERU_MITA_GID` to the numeric GID that can connect to `/run/mita/mita.sock`. That dynamically supplied socket GID must be a distinct nonzero group and must not reuse reserved panel/manager/Caddy/accounting identities `10001` through `10005`; the mandatory state preflight rejects those values. The binary and mita runtime directory are mounted read-only; only manager state and its API runtime directory are writable. The manager health check uses the authenticated Unix API, and the panel waits for it to become healthy.

### Mandatory Compose state provisioning

The container deliberately runs as fixed numeric UID/GID `10005:10005`. Docker creates a missing bind source as host `root:root`, which is not writable by that identity. A host account named `mieru-manager` may have a dynamically allocated UID/GID; its name does not change the container's numeric identity and does not satisfy this contract. Do not share a state directory with a host-systemd manager that uses a different identity.

Before the first `docker compose up`, put the token beneath a trusted root-owned directory tree (for example `/etc/mieru-manager/token`) and check whether `10005` collides with an unrelated host principal. Every token parent must already exist, be root-owned and have no group/other write bits. The preparer deliberately rejects repository-local paths beneath synchronized or developer-writable ancestors. Its parent walk relies on the invariant that only root can rename entries in those directories; the token file itself remains bound to an `O_NOFOLLOW` file descriptor through mutation and final identity verification. No output from these `getent` commands means no host-account collision; any output must identify an intentionally trusted `mieru-manager` principal, otherwise stop and resolve the fixed-ID collision before granting access:

```sh
export MIERU_MANAGER_TOKEN_FILE=/etc/mieru-manager/token
export MIERU_MANAGER_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/mieru-manager
export MIERU_MITA_GID="$(stat -c %g /run/mita/mita.sock)"
getent passwd 10005 || true
getent group 10005 || true
sudo ./scripts/prepare-mieru-token.sh prepare "$MIERU_MANAGER_TOKEN_FILE"
sudo env MIERU_MITA_GID="$MIERU_MITA_GID" ./scripts/prepare-mieru-state.sh prepare "$MIERU_MANAGER_STATE_DIR"
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.mieru.yaml up -d --build
```

Both `prepare` commands are mandatory and must run as root before `docker compose up`. The token preparer requires an explicit absolute normalized path to an existing root-owned regular non-symlink file beneath existing root-owned, non-group/other-writable directories. It rejects hardlinks before mutation, validates a content-blind size bound of 32–513 bytes (32–512 ASCII characters with an optional final newline), and uses `fchown`, `fchmod`, `fsync`, and a final path/descriptor identity check; it never reads or prints token content. Compose preserves this source metadata, allowing manager GID `10005` to read the secret while keeping it unreadable to unrelated identities. Only when `MIERU_ENABLED=true`, the panel first validates the immutable Compose source as exactly `root:10005` mode `0440`, one regular link, and 32–513 bytes, then FD-stages an exclusive `panel:panel` mode-`0400` copy at `/run/panel/mieru-manager-token` before dropping permanently to UID `10001`, GID `101`, and only supplementary GID `10005`. Disabled Mieru never touches the source.

The state preparer refuses `/`, relative or non-normalized paths, symlinked path components, non-directories, and non-empty directories. It creates or repairs only an empty state directory, setting exactly numeric owner `10005:10005` and mode `0700`; it never starts a root container or recursively changes restored data. `MIERU_MANAGER_STATE_DIR` defaults to `/var/lib/mieru-manager` in both the script and Compose. UID `10003` remains exclusively the documented Naive Caddy identity and therefore cannot traverse or read/write Mieru state.

### Restore contract

Stop the Compose services before restoring. Restore the state directory and metadata from trusted backup media, then run the read-only verifier **before** bringing the service up:

```sh
export MIERU_MANAGER_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/mieru-manager
export MIERU_MANAGER_TOKEN_FILE=/etc/mieru-manager/token
export MIERU_MITA_GID="$(getent group mita | cut -d: -f3)"
: "${MIERU_MITA_GID:?mita group is missing}"
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.mieru.yaml stop panel mieru-manager
# Restore trusted backup media here, preserving numeric ownership and modes.
sudo env MIERU_MITA_GID="$MIERU_MITA_GID" ./scripts/prepare-mieru-state.sh verify "$MIERU_MANAGER_STATE_DIR"
sudo ./scripts/prepare-mieru-token.sh verify "$MIERU_MANAGER_TOKEN_FILE"
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.mieru.yaml up -d --build
```

The restored directory must be `10005:10005` mode `0700`. Top-level `state.json`, `writer.lock`, `journal.json`, and `journal.key`, when present, must be regular non-symlink files owned by `10005:10005` with mode `0600`; `journal.key` must be exactly 32 bytes. `backups/` must be a real directory owned by `10005:10005` with mode `0700`, and each direct backup file must be regular, non-symlink, `10005:10005`, and mode `0600`. The verifier checks metadata and key size only: it does not read or print key, journal, state, or backup contents, and it does not chown or chmod restored files.

An active `journal.json` and its original `journal.key` are one recovery unit. Always co-restore them. Never delete or regenerate `journal.key` to make a restored journal start: the manager must authenticate that journal before recovery and intentionally fails closed when the key is absent or changed. If `prepare` reports that a directory is non-empty, use `verify` after restoring correct metadata; do not use a recursive `chown` as a substitute for reviewing the restored recovery set.

## Listener coexistence

Declare every TCP/UDP Mieru port or range explicitly. **No installer or manager silently takes port 443.** When nginx/MTProxy/NaiveProxy already owns shared 443, choose dedicated Mieru ports (for example 8443 TCP and 8443 UDP), publish them in host/cloud firewalls, and verify both protocols. Loopback management sockets are unrelated to public listeners.

Config updates are full-snapshot CAS transactions with durable backup/journal recovery. Journal v3 metadata is authenticated with a manager-local 32-byte HMAC key stored as an exact mode-0600 regular file in the state directory; the key is never included in backups, logs, audit records, or API responses. Recovery fails closed if an active journal cannot be authenticated. Ports, MTU, DNS, egress, traffic patterns and SSRF flags use stop/start. Credential rotation, disable, and delete force restart for revocation; quota-only changes may reload. Unknown observed fields fail closed.

Per-user Mieru traffic metrics are deliberately reported as degraded/unavailable in this MIT adapter. In v3.35 and v3.36, `mita get metrics` is opaque grouped diagnostics and `mita get users` renders a human table; only the GPL gRPC `GetUsers` boundary exposes typed histories. The adapter does not invent a JSON shape, parse rounded table values, copy GPL-generated stubs, or claim baseline reset support. Traffic and quota semantics in mita itself remain **application bytes** and rolling approximate session-admission checks—not hard caps or billing counters.

## Fleet limitation

Fleet v1 is Telemt-only. It does not advertise or accept Mieru inspect, metrics, lifecycle, credential, or configuration operations, and the node agent does not consume Mieru manager sockets or tokens. Operate Mieru through its authenticated manager boundary and panel APIs; do not persist decrypted credentials in fleet SQLite. A future Fleet protocol would require a separately versioned execution and reconciliation contract before any Mieru operation can be enabled.
