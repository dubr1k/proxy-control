# Sharing Mieru configurations

**English** · [Русский](MIERU_SHARING.ru.md)

Proxy Control discloses Mieru credentials only after **create** or **controlled rotation**. List APIs, UI tables, and audit never contain passwords, `mierus://` URLs, QR payloads, or reveal tokens.

## Create access

1. Open **Mieru**.
2. Select **Add**.
3. Enter username and optional rolling quota/expiry.
4. A one-time dialog opens after creation.
5. Select the target client:
   - **Native**: copy the official `mierus://` URL or shell-safe `mieru import config 'mierus://…'` command; its QR contains that exact URL.
   - **Karing**: open or scan a `karing://install-config` deep link containing a complete Mieru sing-box profile, or download that JSON profile. This variant is offered only when every binding is a single exact port.
   - **Shadowrocket**: not offered. There is no verified Mieru import format, and Proxy Control does not fabricate one.
6. Confirm import, then close the dialog.

The reveal response carries `Cache-Control: no-store`. URL and QR exist in frontend only inside the ephemeral dialog and are cleared on close.

## Reissue for an existing user

Mita stores `hashedPassword`; plaintext cannot be recovered. The previous URL/QR therefore cannot be safely displayed after one-time reveal expires.

Select **New link + QR**. The panel:

1. generates a new credential;
2. performs controlled restart/reload under Mieru transaction policy;
3. invalidates the previous client configuration;
4. displays a new one-time URL and QR.

Warn the user that the old config stops working as soon as rotation succeeds.

## Client matrix

| Client | Exact-port Mieru access | Port-range access | QR payload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Official Mieru | `mierus://`, import command | Supported | The displayed `mierus://` URL |
| Karing | Full Mieru sing-box profile, download, and `karing://install-config` | Not offered | The Karing deep link containing the full profile |
| Shadowrocket | Not offered; no verified format | Not offered | None |

Use an official Mieru client compatible with server `mita` 3.35.x, or a current Karing build. The [official Mieru client guide](https://github.com/enfein/mieru/blob/main/docs/client-install.md) defines `mierus://`, `mieru import config`, and the sing-box Mieru outbound fields. Karing documents configuration-content import and its [URL scheme](https://karing.app/en/cooperation/scheme); its current source lists the Mieru outbound type.

After import verify expected hostname/port, declared TCP/UDP listener reachability, end-to-end transport, and rejection of the old config after rotation. Never paste any credential payload into a broadly visible ticket/chat or screenshot.

## QR security contract

The QR is client-specific. On **Native**, it encodes the exact displayed `mierus://` URL. On **Karing**, it encodes the exact displayed `karing://install-config` deep link whose `url` parameter is the full Mieru profile. A QR never substitutes a raw HTTP endpoint or an unsupported-client format. Backend creates each SVG from the declared payload, and frontend rejects QR metadata that does not match the selected payload.

Never:

- store URL/QR in localStorage or sessionStorage;
- return them from list APIs;
- write them to audit/application logs;
- reveal them to a viewer;
- include them in backups, screenshots, or issues;
- attempt to recover password from a hash.

Create, rotate, and reveal require authorized mutation roles and CSRF where applicable.

## Dialog closed too early

Do not search the DB or logs. Perform another **New link + QR** rotation and deliver the new credential. One-time disclosure is intentional.

## Mobile UI

Client tabs scroll horizontally, while QR, payload, import command, unsupported-client notice, and actions stack inside the dialog on narrow screens. Responsive gates cover widths from 320 px and require zero horizontal document overflow. The selected client controls both the visible payload and QR; closing the dialog clears every variant and revokes generated download URLs.

## Troubleshooting

- **No QR:** use the create/rotate one-time dialog, not list view.
- **Old link fails:** expected after rotation.
- **New link imports but cannot connect:** check server status, TCP/UDP listener, DNS/firewall, and real protocol probe.
- **Client created both TCP and UDP entries, only TCP works:** `mierus://` advertises every server port binding, so clients such as NekoBox/husi materialise one entry per protocol. The server-side UDP listener is fine: the official mieru 3.35 client with `"protocol": "UDP"` completes end-to-end through mita 3.35. In practice UDP fails on the path (mobile carriers and some Wi-Fi networks drop or throttle non-QUIC UDP) or in a given client fork's UDP transport. Action: use the TCP entry; there is no need to remove the server's UDP binding. To verify the server, point the official client at a UDP-only profile — if that works, the fault is client- or network-side.
- **Traffic unavailable:** this is an honest adapter limitation, not a credential problem.
- **Viewer sees no QR:** expected RBAC behavior.
