# Automated Proxy Control installation on Ubuntu 24.04

**English** · [Русский](INSTALL.ru.md)

Root-only `install.sh` invokes transactional `scripts/proxyctl.py install`. Supported lifecycle:

```text
audit → plan → install → repair → uninstall
```

The complete installer deploys Telemt/MTProxy and the panel. NaiveProxy, Mieru, and fleet are separate integrations applied only after core acceptance.

## The primary install path: a verified release

This is the supported way to install Proxy Control. It replaces the manual
`scripts/proxyctl.py` sequence below, which stays documented for an existing
deployment and for reviewing what the installer does.

Download the archive, its `SHA256SUMS`, and `release-manifest.json` from the
release page, then verify provenance **before** anything runs with privilege:

```bash installer-check
gh attestation verify proxy-control-v0.1.0.tar.gz --repo dubr1k/proxy-control
sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
./install-bootstrap --archive proxy-control-v0.1.0.tar.gz --checksum SHA256SUMS --manifest release-manifest.json
```

The order matters: the attestation is checked first, and only then is anything
handed to `sudo`. `install-bootstrap` refuses to run as root, verifies that
every input is a regular file you own that is not group- or other-writable,
compares the archive against the published checksum, requires the manifest to
name the same archive and digest, refuses a prerelease version, and preflights
the archive for absolute or escaping members before its single `exec sudo`.
Nothing is ever downloaded and executed in one step.

With no further arguments the installer starts a bilingual wizard that writes a
configuration file, shows a plan, and applies nothing until you confirm the plan
digest. The complete surface - profiles, every configuration field, ownership
boundaries, per-protocol acceptance, WARP and egress, recovery, and reports -
is in the [installer reference](docs/INSTALLER_REFERENCE.en.md).

Before installing a profile that includes Mieru, stage both pinned upstream
packages for your architecture in `/var/lib/proxy-control/`:
`mita_3.36.0_<arch>.deb` (the server) and `mieru_3.36.0_<arch>.deb` (the
official client the acceptance runs). The installer never downloads them and
refuses to continue unless each digest matches its pin; the URLs and digests are
in [`release/external-artifacts.json`](release/external-artifacts.json).

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04 with systemd;
- root/sudo;
- DNS A/AAAA for proxy and panel names points directly to the host;
- TCP/80 available for ACME HTTP-01;
- public TCP/443 owned by an existing Nginx `stream` listener;
- exactly one understandable `$ssl_preread_server_name` map in the selected route file;
- free loopback ports;
- external executable probe that validates real Fake-TLS/Obfuscated2 `req_pq_multi → resPQ`;
- host-level backup of Nginx, services, and adjacent routes.

Disable CDN/proxying for the raw MTProto hostname. Unhandled AAAA, NAT mismatch, ambiguous maps, and port collisions are hard stops.

Use restrictive `umask 077` only inside a secret/backup subshell. Restore `022` before Git clone, Docker build contexts, and APT; public ACME roots and `.well-known/acme-challenge` must be mode `0755`. If the proxy/panel certificate is pre-issued, use `/var/www/<proxy-domain>` and `/var/www/<panel-domain>` in its renewal map from the first issuance.

## Build and install the external TDLib probe

From the checked-out repository, build the pinned Docker image and install the root-only hook before planning:

```bash
sudo ./probe/install.sh
```

It installs `/usr/local/libexec/mtproxy-respq-probe` with mode `0750`. The hook accepts exactly `--domain DOMAIN --secrets-file PATH`; it validates both inputs, binds the file read-only at `/run/mtproxy/users.conf`, and asks TDLib to `addProxy` then `pingProxy` once for every configured secret. The image base is pinned by digest and its Node dependencies are locked in `probe/package-lock.json`.

The installer supplies only the domain and secret-file path. Individual secrets never enter its argv, the Docker command argv, shell history, or probe output. The container has a read-only root filesystem, a dedicated tmpfs for TDLib state, dropped capabilities, and no-new-privileges. Its only success output is the verified-secret count; any failed secret makes the hook fail closed.

## 1. Read-only audit

```bash
sudo python3 scripts/proxyctl.py audit \
  --proxy-domain proxy.example.com \
  --panel-domain panel.example.com \
  --json
```

Audit installs no package and mutates no file/service. Review listener ownership, DNS, Nginx topology, platform, and collisions.

## 2. Deterministic plan

```bash
sudo python3 scripts/proxyctl.py plan \
  --proxy-domain proxy.example.com \
  --panel-domain panel.example.com \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --route-file /etc/nginx/stream.d/routes.conf \
  --project-dir /opt/mtproxy-shared443 \
  --users owner,phone \
  --protocol-probe /usr/local/bin/mtproxy-respq-probe \
  --json
```

Plan contains no passwords, tokens, user secrets, or access links. Verify managed paths, package ownership, certificate names, loopback ports, route change, and probe path.

## 3. Backup readiness

Before installation preserve the selected Nginx route and includes with metadata, private `nginx -T`, active listeners/units, existing Docker state, and adjacent SNI acceptance results. Installer-owned backups do not replace an independent host backup.

## 4. Install

```bash
sudo ./install.sh \
  --proxy-domain proxy.example.com \
  --panel-domain panel.example.com \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --route-file /etc/nginx/stream.d/routes.conf \
  --project-dir /opt/mtproxy-shared443 \
  --users owner,phone \
  --protocol-probe /usr/local/bin/mtproxy-respq-probe
```

The installer installs only missing packages, obtains a two-name certificate, creates mode-restricted secrets, deploys Compose project `mtproxy`, bootstraps owner through stdin, applies minimal Nginx routes transactionally, waits for health, and runs the required external probe.

It never changes UFW/nftables/iptables, DNS, Xray/3x-ui, unrelated containers, or unrelated Nginx routes.

## 5. Acceptance

```bash
docker compose -f /opt/mtproxy-shared443/compose.yaml ps
curl -fsS -H 'Host: panel.example.com' http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz
sudo nginx -t
ss -lntup
```

Also run external `resPQ` for each user secret, a real Telegram client test, panel HTTPS/login, adjacent SNI regression, SQLite integrity/backup checksum, and confirm Telemt API is not host-published.

After adding Naive or another adjacent SNI route, run `sudo python3 scripts/proxyctl.py repair`. Current `main` validates only the ownership-marker block and uninstall removes only that block, preserving routes added later. Upgrade deployments that still hash the whole route file before expanding the map.

After every renewal hook is installed, run `sudo certbot renew --dry-run --no-random-sleep-on-renew`; initial issuance does not verify the future renewal webroot map.

## 6. Repair

```bash
sudo python3 scripts/proxyctl.py repair
```

`repair` loads `/var/lib/proxy-control/runtime.json`, completes interrupted recovery, validates owned files, and restarts the recorded runtime. It intentionally accepts no arbitrary paths.

## 7. Uninstall

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
# Destructive: remove Compose named volumes as a separate journaled phase.
sudo ./uninstall.sh --purge-data
```

Uninstall durable-checkpoints phases, removes only owned routes/files/packages, and preserves Compose named volumes, credential backup, certificates, and cover roots by default. Repeated execution resumes safely; an interrupted data-purging uninstall must be resumed with `--purge-data`. Use that flag only after verifying an independent volume backup. Revalidate Nginx/listeners/adjacent SNI afterward.

## Interrupted SSH

SSH exit `255` proves transport failure only. Inspect durable manifest phase/status, owned files, services, and protocol probe on the target host. Never blindly rerun installation over an active generation.
